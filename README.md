# Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design? What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
Our client was Gaming Room. They currently have a game called Draw It or Lost It for Android. The Gaming Room wanted to improve and to expand the software to other platforms. I developed this document as requested, it is clear and straightforward to understand.

# What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
It helped in keeping focus on the task assigned and to decide on the process of achieving it.

# If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I would revise the evaluation part. I would improve it by giving more details about why I chose my development tools. 

# How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
It is important to consider the users' needs because without users your software is pointless. I interpreted their needs by focusing on the functionality of the app and what will they need to use them. 

# How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
I focused on the documentation and seperate the game from the game needs functionality to allow easier updates and maintenence. In the future, I would use the same strategies used for this software application.
